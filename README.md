# Autonomous Delivery Agent - CSA2001 AI/ML Project

## Project Overview
Design and implementation of an autonomous delivery agent that navigates a 2D grid city to deliver packages using various AI search algorithms.

## Project Requirements Met
- Uninformed Search: BFS, Uniform Cost Search
- Informed Search: A* with admissible heuristic (Manhattan distance)
- Local Search Replanning: Hill-climbing for dynamic obstacles
- Dynamic Obstacles: Time-aware path planning
- 4 Test Maps: Small, medium, large, and dynamic scenarios
- Experimental Comparison: Path cost, nodes expanded, computation time

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies required

### Installation
